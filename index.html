        <h2>Counselling:</h2>
        <p>
           The aim of counselling is to allow a person to talk through their problems with someone who is trained to listen and not judge. I will take the time to fully understand your feelings and thoughts. This can be really helpful, as this simple process can allow you to find answers which you can use to cope better with whatever is going on for you.
        </p>
        <p>   
           There are so many different types of counselling it can be difficult to know which one is right for you. To help with this, below is a brief description of the talking therapies available through me.

            <h2>Hypnotherapy:</h2>
            <p>
                I will spend some time helping you to enter a relaxed state. During the hypnosis you will be fully aware of your surroundings and you will be in full control. I use techniques that are personal to you and tailored to your needs (I do not use scripts). We may also explore other aspects of treatment such as lifestyle, diet and exercise.
            </p>
            <p>
                Hypnotherapy doesn't involve you losing consciousness. It simply aids you in entering a relaxed state. We enter trance-like states multiple times in any day; for example, have you ever been engrossed in reading a book?
