Welcome to my website, created for TalkLiveCounselling - a start-up business created by my family. 


HTML Validator: 

During writing up the inital code for this site, I had put my HTML through the validator to help stop any errors, there was an error with me using <span> for the Meet the Therapists section for each of the two Therapists, quickly rectified by changing the <span> to a <div>. The only other errors were spelling errors and using HTML to style the <iframe> - to rectify this I styled in CSS. 
  
 At the end of writing the code, I submitted again through the validator to only find the one error, as per below. To fix, the space was removed and code then passed sucessfully.
